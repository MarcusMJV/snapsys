# SnapSys

**SnapSys** is a lightweight system benchmarking and diagnostics tool for Linux, written in Go. It captures system metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk usage at fixed intervals over a given duration and stores them in a structured, newline-delimited JSON (`.jsonl`) file.

---

## Use Cases

SnapSys is ideal for:

- Lightweight benchmarking without heavy monitoring tools
- Debugging and identifying system spikes
- Gathering structured system metrics over time
- Exporting snapshots for post-analysis using tools like `jq`, Python, or Grafana
- Logging system state during stress testing, CI pipelines, or regression runs
- Educational or research experiments requiring structured, time-series system data

---

## Features

- Collects:
  - **CPU**: % used, raw time stats (user, system, idle, iowait, etc.)
  - **Memory**: % used, available, and raw usage in kilobytes
  - **Disk**: % used and raw disk space per mount point
- Outputs a `.jsonl` file (newline-delimited JSON)
- Runs from CLI with flexible flags
- Automatically creates output files with timestamped filenames
- Sensible defaults (no flags needed for basic use)
- Prevents invalid intervals or outputs with helpful errors

| ------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--interval` | `duration` | `3s`            | Time between each snapshot. Must be â‰¥ 1s.                                                 |
| `--duration` | `duration` | `30s`           | Total time to run the snapshot collection.                                                |
| `--output`   | `string`   | *autogenerated* | Output file path. Must end in `.jsonl`. If omitted, a file is created in `snapsys_runs/`. |
| `--version`  | -          | -               | Print the SnapSys version and exit.                                                       |
